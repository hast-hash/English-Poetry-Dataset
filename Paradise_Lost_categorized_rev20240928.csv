172,Now to the ascent of that steep savage hill,
173,"Satan had journeyed on, pensive and slow;",
174,"But further way found none, so thick entwined,",
175,"As one continued brake, the undergrowth",
176,Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed,
177,All path of man or beast that passed that way.,
178,"One gate there only was, and that looked east",
179,"On the other side: which when the arch-felon saw,",
180,"Due entrance he disdained; and, in contempt,",
181,At one flight bound high over-leaped all bound,
182,"Of hill or highest wall, and sheer within",
183,"Lights on his feet. As when a prowling wolf,",
184,"Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey,",
185,Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve,
186,"In hurdled cotes amid the field secure,",
187,Leaps o’er the fence with ease into the fold:,
188,"Or as a thief, bent to unhoard the cash",
189,"Of some rich burgher, whose substantial doors,",
190,"Cross-barred and bolted fast, fear no assault,",
191,"In at the window climbs, or o’er the tiles:",
192,So clomb this first grand thief into God’s fold;,
193,So since into his church lewd hirelings climb.,
194,"Thence up he flew, and on the tree of life,",
195,"The middle tree and highest there that grew,",
196,Sat like a cormorant; yet not true life,
197,"Thereby regained, but sat devising death",
198,To them who lived; nor on the virtue thought,
199,"Of that life-giving plant, but only used",
200,"For prospect, what well used had been the pledge",
201,Of immortality. So little knows,
202,"Any, but God alone, to value right",
203,"The good before him, but perverts best things",
204,"To worst abuse, or to their meanest use.",
205,"Beneath him with new wonder now he views,",h
206,"To all delight of human sense exposed,",h
207,"In narrow room, Nature’s whole wealth, yea more,",h
208,A Heaven on Earth: For blissful Paradise,h
209,"Of God the garden was, by him in the east",h
210,Of Eden planted; Eden stretched her line,h
211,From Auran eastward to the royal towers,"g,h"
212,"Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian kings,","g,h"
213,Or where the sons of Eden long before,"g,h"
214,Dwelt in Telassar: In this pleasant soil,"a,g,h"
215,His far more pleasant garden God ordained;,"a,h"
216,Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow,"c,h"
217,"All trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste;","c,h"
218,"And all amid them stood the tree of life,","d,h"
219,"High eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit","d,h"
220,"Of vegetable gold; and next to life,","d,h"
221,"Our death, the tree of knowledge, grew fast by,","d,h"
222,Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill.,"d,h"
223,"Southward through Eden went a river large,","b,h"
224,"Nor changed his course, but through the shaggy hill","b,h"
225,Passed underneath ingulfed; for God had thrown,"b,e,h,k"
226,That mountain as his garden-mould high raised,"e,h,k"
227,"Upon the rapid current, which, through veins","e,h,k"
228,"Of porous earth with kindly thirst up-drawn,","e,h"
229,"Rose a fresh fountain, and with many a rill","d,e,f,h"
230,Watered the garden; thence united fell,"d,f,h"
231,"Down the steep glade, and met the nether flood,","b,d,f,h"
232,"Which from his darksome passage now appears,","b,f,h"
233,"And now, divided into four main streams,","f,h"
234,"Runs diverse, wandering many a famous realm","f,h"
235,"And country, whereof here needs no account;","f,h"
236,"But rather to tell how, if Art could tell,","f,h"
237,"How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks,","d,f,h"
238,"Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold,","d,f,h"
239,With mazy errour under pendant shades,"d,f,h"
240,"Ran nectar, visiting each plant, and fed","d,f,h"
241,"Flowers worthy of Paradise, which not nice Art","d,f,h"
242,"In beds and curious knots, but Nature boon",h
243,"Poured forth profuse on hill, and dale, and plain,",h
244,Both where the morning sun first warmly smote,"h,j"
245,"The open field, and where the unpierced shade","h,j"
246,Imbrowned the noontide bowers: Thus was this place,"d,h,j"
247,A happy rural seat of various view;,"d,h"
248,"Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm,","d,h"
249,"Others whose fruit, burnished with golden rind,","d,h"
250,"Hung amiable, Hesperian fables true,","d,h"
251,"If true, here only, and of delicious taste:","d,h"
252,"Betwixt them lawns, or level downs, and flocks","d,h"
253,"Grazing the tender herb, were interposed,","d,h"
254,Or palmy hillock; or the flowery lap,"d,h"
255,"Of some irriguous valley spread her store,","d,h"
256,"Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose:","d,h"
257,"Another side, umbrageous grots and caves","d,h"
258,"Of cool recess, o’er which the mantling vine","d,h"
259,"Lays forth her purple grape, and gently creeps","d,h"
260,Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall,"f,d,h"
261,"Down the slope hills, dispersed, or in a lake,","f,d,h"
262,That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned,"f,d,h"
263,"Her crystal mirrour holds, unite their streams.","f,d,h"
264,"The birds their quire apply; airs, vernal airs,",h
265,"Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune",h
266,"The trembling leaves, while universal Pan,",h
267,"Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance,",
268,Led on the eternal Spring. Not that fair field,
269,"Of Enna, where Proserpine gathering flowers,",
270,Herself a fairer flower by gloomy Dis,
271,"Was gathered, which cost Ceres all that pain",
272,To seek her through the world; nor that sweet grove,
273,"Of Daphne by Orontes, and the inspired",
274,"Castalian spring, might with this Paradise",
275,Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian isle,g
276,"Girt with the river Triton, where old Cham,",g
277,"Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove,",g
278,"Hid Amalthea, and her florid son",g
279,"Young Bacchus, from his stepdame Rhea’s eye;",g
280,"Nor where Abassin kings their issue guard,",g
281,"Mount Amara, though this by some supposed","d,g,h"
282,True Paradise under the Ethiop line,"d,g,h"
283,"By Nilus’ head, enclosed with shining rock,","d,g,h"
284,"A whole day’s journey high, but wide remote",i
285,"From this Assyrian garden, where the Fiend",i
286,"Saw, undelighted, all delight, all kind",
287,"Of living creatures, new to sight, and strange",
